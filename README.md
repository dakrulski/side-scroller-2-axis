Side-Scrolling 2 axis Boilerplate
=================================

Introduction
------------
This project is for learning purposes and should not be deployed in production.

I try to create a boilerplate for side-scroller 2 axis games in the browser with [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/).
The backend is a simple python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app.

I also want to write the boilerplate in the ECMA 6 specification with the help of [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

And I want to add some cool things like a [blender](https://www.blender.org/) script to make animation spritesheets.

Installation
------------

1. Get the source-code.
2. Create a virtualenv with python3.4 (Use a searchengine for more information)
3. Activate the virtualenv (Also use a searchengine for more information)

4. Install the requirements with pip:

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Start
-----

```python server.py```

And then visit 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser. (Should be a modern browser with webGL support)
